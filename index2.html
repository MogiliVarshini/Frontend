        <p><strong>Steven Paul Jobs</strong> (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and investor who co-founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.">Apple Inc</a>. Jobs was also chairman and majority shareholder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar</a>, and the founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a>. He was a pioneer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers">personal computer revolution</a> of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>.</p><br>
        <p>Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_College">Reed College</a> in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie_trail">seeking enlightenment</a> before later studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_the_West#Emerging_mainstream_western_Buddhism">Zen Buddhism</a>. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">Apple I</a> personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, one of the first highly successful mass-produced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer">microcomputers</a>. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto">Xerox Alto</a> in 1979, which was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse">mouse-</a>driven and had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface</a> (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa">Apple Lisa</a> in 1983, followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K">the breakthrough Macintosh</a> in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing">desktop publishing</a> industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserWriter">LaserWriter</a>, the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_printing">laser printer</a> to feature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">vector graphics</a>.</p><br>
        <p>In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley">John Sculley</a>. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform">computer platform</a> development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects">visual effects</a> industry by funding the computer graphics division of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a> that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which produced the first 3D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation">computer-animated</a> feature film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story">Toy Story</a> (1995) and became a leading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation_studio">animation studio</a>, producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films">over 27 films</a> since.</p><br>
        <p>In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive">Jony Ive</a> to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different">Think different</a>" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_neuroendocrine_tumor">pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor</a>.

            By March 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it; Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed.[62] In April of that same year, Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company (now called "Apple Inc.") as a business partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist Drive home on April 1, 1976. The operation originally started in Jobs's bedroom and later moved to the garage.[63][64] Wayne stayed briefly, leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company.

            The two decided on the name "Apple" after Jobs returned from the All One Farm commune in Oregon and told Wozniak about his time in the farm's apple orchard.[66] Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists for $50 (equivalent to about $260 in 2022) each. To fund the first batch, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator and Jobs sold his Volkswagen van.[67][68] Later that year, computer retailer Paul Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled Apple I units for $500 each.[69][70] Eventually about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total.[71]

            A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who would greet his clients "with his underwear hanging out, barefoot and hippie-like". Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, recalled dismissing Jobs's budding business compared to the established industry of giant mainframe computers with big decks of punch cards: "Steve took me over to the garage. He had a circuit board with a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. He said, 'This is an Apple computer.' I said, 'You've got to be joking.' I dismissed the whole idea." Jobs's friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke, recalled that as an early Apple employee, he "was the only person who worked in the garage ... Woz would show up once a week with his latest code. Steve Jobs didn't get his hands dirty in that sense." Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Jobs's kitchen, where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.[21]

            They received funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer named Mike Markkula.[72] Scott McNealy, one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems, said that Jobs broke a "glass age ceiling" in Silicon Valley because he'd created a very successful company at a young age.[31] Markkula brought Apple to the attention of Arthur Rock, which, after looking at the crowded Apple booth at the Home Brew Computer Show, started with a $60,000 investment and went on the Apple board.[73] Jobs was not pleased when Markkula recruited Mike Scott from National Semiconductor in February 1977 to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple.

            After Brennan returned from her own journey to India, she and Jobs fell in love again, as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to Kobun (whom she was also still following). It was also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype Apple II computer for Brennan and his parents in their living room. Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on Jobs were Apple Inc. and Kobun

            In April 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire.[76] It is the first consumer product to have been sold by Apple Computer. Primarily designed by Wozniak, Jobs oversaw the development of its unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply.[77] During the design stage, Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted eight. After a heated argument, Wozniak threatened that Jobs should "go get himself another computer". They later agreed on eight slots.[78] The Apple II became one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products in the world

            As Jobs became more successful with his new company, his relationship with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship, and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino.[citation needed] Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple.[80] Brennan's relationship with Jobs deteriorated as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples".[citation needed] Both Holt and Jobs believed that it would be a good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant, and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan, "turned ugly" at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that."[citation needed] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.
        </div><br>

            Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her "If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" and "I am never going to help you".[citation needed] According to Brennan, Jobs "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around, and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child". A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm. She accepted the offer.[citation needed] When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him)[81] Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.

            The Macintosh's struggle continued after Jobs left Apple. Though marketed and received in fanfare, the expensive Macintosh was hard to sell.[107]: 308–309  In 1985, Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted "a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing its graphical user interface ... for DOS, which it was calling Windows and didn't want Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface."[107]: 321  Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple.[107]: 321  In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so "through the late 1980s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple".[107]: 322  Windows-based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM,[107]: 322  and thus "the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the 1980s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market".
